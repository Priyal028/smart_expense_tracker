# SmartExpenseTracker

A lightweight, secure expense tracking application to record, categorize, and analyze personal and small-business expenses. Designed for simplicity, portability, and easy integration with common databases and front-end frameworks.

## Features
- Track expenses and income with category and tag support
- Recurring transactions and adjustable budgets
- Multi-currency support with basic conversion
- Transaction search, filter, and sorting
- CSV export / import for transactions
- Summary dashboards: daily/weekly/monthly reports and charts
- User authentication and per-user data isolation
- REST API for integrations and mobile clients

## Installation

Prerequisites
- Node.js (14+) and npm or yarn for JavaScript stacks
- OR Python 3.8+ and pip for Python stacks
- Git
- (Optional) PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite for persistence

Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/SmartExpenseTracker.git
cd SmartExpenseTracker
```

Backend (example)
```bash
cd backend
# install
npm install
# copy and update env file
cp .env.example .env
# run migrations (if applicable)
npm run migrate
# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend (example)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

If your project uses Python/Django or Flask, replace the backend steps:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
flask run  # or python manage.py runserver
```

## Usage

- Open the frontend UI (usually http://localhost:3000) and register an account.
- Add categories, set budgets, and add your first expense.
- Use filters and reports to analyze spending over time.
- Export transactions via the "Export" action for backup or external analysis.

Common CLI scripts (adjust to repo):
```bash
# run both services concurrently (if configured)
npm run dev:all

# run tests
npm test

# build frontend for production
cd frontend && npm run build
```

## Configuration

Typical environment variables (adjust names to match your codebase)
- DATABASE_URL - Database connection string
- PORT - Backend port
- FRONTEND_PORT - Frontend dev port
- JWT_SECRET or SECRET_KEY - Authentication secret
- CORS_ORIGINS - Allowed front-end origins

See .env.example files in each subdirectory for exact keys used by this repository.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React / Vue / Svelte (single-page app)
- Backend: Node.js + Express or Python + Flask/Django (REST API)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite (configurable)
- Authentication: JWT or session-based auth
- Build & Tooling: npm / yarn, Webpack / Vite, Docker (optional)

Adjust this section to reflect the actual technologies present in the repository.

## Testing
- Unit and integration tests live in backend/tests and frontend/tests
- Run tests:
```bash
# backend
cd backend && npm test

# frontend
cd frontend && npm test
```
